# Project Overview
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that impacts social and communication skills, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe.

# Motivation

- **Current Diagnostic Challenges**: ASD diagnosis relies on expert clinicians observing a child's behavior, as there are no biomarkers or blood tests for this condition. Existing methods are often subjective, time-consuming, and stressful for parents due to long wait times.
- **Research Insights**: Studies show that children with ASD are more likely to engage with robots during activities compared to typically developing children.

# Aim

- **Objective**: Streamline ASD diagnosis by using a behavior-based approach that facilitates rapid detection and clinical prioritization of at-risk children.
- **Method**: Implement socially assistive robots to track facial expressions and upper body movements, identifying ASD-specific behaviors.
- **Target Group**: Focus on early diagnosis in children aged 3 to 6 years.

# Key Activities

A humanoid NAO robot will interact with children through the following tasks to engage them in social, physical, and cognitive activities:

1. **Introductory Dance**: Assesses motor skills, coordination, and social engagement.
2. **Learning Body Parts**: Evaluates imitation skills and cognitive development.
3. **Imitating Frog Jumps**: Tests movement imitation and instructional comprehension.
4. **Joint Attention**: Observes social communication by pointing out different objects.
5. **Emotion Recognition with Card Matching**: Assesses understanding of facial expressions and social cues.
6. **Rolly Polly Dance**: Evaluates motor skills and sequence following.
7. **Eye Contact with Peekaboo**: Assesses eye contact and response to social interaction.


These activities, while not direct diagnostic tools, contribute to a broader assessment process when used by professionals, helping to identify early signs of ASD.
